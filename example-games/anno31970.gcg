#player1 Avery Avery
#player2 Gibson Gibson
>Avery: ACNOORR H7 RANCOR +18 18
#note Not sure here. I want to keep the board open long-term against Gibson especially, so this makes it hard for him to deal with both the top and bottom since the C gets in the way. I missed both NARCO and ACORN, which might be a little better.
>Gibson: AIILTTV 12G T.IVIAL +20 20
#note I have a couple of Gibson's racks.
>Avery: AAILNOR 13C LAARI +15 33
#note Spent forever here trying to find a play I liked. Again, I want to keep the board open long-term, and this makes some spots he can't deal with all at once. LIANA, LANAI, NORIA were all my considerations. Really not sure here.
>Gibson: AEGTTUY 12B GEY +26 46
#note It seems counterintuitive that GEY would be better than GAY, but the two sim in a dead heat since 4 A's have already been played, and no E's have been played. GAY comes out on top a little, but it's very close.
>Avery: CELNNOR G5 CLONE +17 50
#note I came close to doing COLIN, but I didn't like the board shape after that against Gibson. I did this to open the top a little. Everything seems lousy though.
>Gibson: AGITTUU 5G .ATGUT +18 64
#note He wanted to block the double-double. I would have done GUILT probably.
>Avery: AENOPRU M10 PU.AO +14 64
#note At this point, my clock was well over half gone, so when I looked at the clock, I panicked and tried to play fast. This is so bad, and yet I got bailed out. I had 9 minutes left after this play. CP puts this in its choices, but I missed AREPA, which seems best.
>Gibson: IIIKNTU L3 IN.UIT +14 78
#note We both struggled with our early racks, and then the tides turned.
>Avery: DEEFNRS 15G FENDERS +94 158
>Gibson: DIKN H1 KIND. +36 114
>Avery: ABBEELN J2 BAN.LE +17 175
#note Did this to muck up the top bingo lines and go for a blank, which I felt would be a major deciding factor in who came out on top in this game. F7 NABE is also a good idea.
>Gibson: EEW 14D WEE +23 137
#note He regretted not playing this at 14H or something, since the P and S's are unseen still. He knew the L's and N's were gone, but forgot about the P.
>Avery: BEEIORR 14H BIER +21 196
#note Keep in mind I'm already down to like 7 minutes because of the first few plays, so I'm autopiloting a bit since the endgame is likely to be close. This is best on equity, and I'm fine with that. Not playing something like BOREEN since he's bound to be close to a bingo.
>Gibson: EF N13 EF +22 159
>Avery: DEIORSX 15A OXES +47 243
#note Even if he plays like MO or something, I get a net gain on points, so this is fine.
>Gibson: EEIMOTV N4 EMOTIVE +72 231
>Avery: ADIPRST O4 RAPID +49 292
#note Almost autopiloted to PARDI, but slowed down to find this. Thankfully I didn't play rapidly. That pool is looking weird though.
>Gibson: GMY O10 GYM +18 249
>Avery: ?HJOSTZ 14A JO +45 337
#note Super lucky draw from that pool. This outruns pretty much everything, and I save M1 QAT or QIS in reserve.
>Gibson: ?AHOSUW F9 WHO +23 272
#note Nice play by him to brace for the Q which was in the bag, but it works well with any other draw too. He's sunk anyway though. CP suggests the nice 10G SCHWA, with this 6th, which doesn't make sense.
>Avery: ?DHOSTZ 10H .aZH +37 374
#note Out of time, but this is the best endgame.
>Gibson: ?AQSU 10A sQUAS. +37 309
>Gibson:  (DOST) +10 319
