#note Actually this might be worse than the game against Glenn Dunlop. I miss URARI to start.
>Chris_Schneider: DFILNO D4 INFOLD +28 28
>Matthew_Larocque: EGILLRT F7 G.LL +7 15
#note Everything is dumb here. I don't want to play IGLU because I don't want to keep ELRT. C1 GILL?

#note His actual rack. Setting up HI.
>Matthew_Larocque: GNNSTTV -GNTV +0 85
#note The problem with VENTS/GULLS is he's going to have an E 90% of time.

>Matthew_Larocque: CNRSTUU --  -74 139
#note The game really isn't that far out of reach. Up until this game, I had only played two phony words. I guess I never found myself in positions where I had to try dumb plays or bluff. For whatever reason, my mindset here was that I needed to catch a break and make something out of nothing.
>Chris_Schneider: BEEINST K5 EB.NITES +90 281
#note More like, make nothing out of nothing!
>Matthew_Larocque: CNRSTUU 2B U.CURT +20 159
#note This is no good either! UNCUT is even available, and arguably better.
>Chris_Schneider: AINRRV 1G INVAR +26 307
>Matthew_Larocque: AEKNOPS 12A PO.N +31 190
#note There's higher scoring plays burning the S, but I was feeling attached to it at this time.

#note Wow, SOAKAGES for 96.

#note Missed my last couple racks.
>Chris_Schneider: AAOOV -AAOOV +0 382

#note I hadn't realized it, but I had been on a 69-game streak where I never scored sub-300. And I only had one such instance in the last 143 games! I guess I can let this one go... ;)
