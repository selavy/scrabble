>Chris_Schneider: AAEITV 8C AVIATE +26 26
#note I think this game was the worst played game of all my games. This also is probably the last one I annotate because Josh has my racks and he's annotating our two.
>Luckbox_Lindh: CEGLNOT C7 G.L +7 7
#note This was awful! I tunneled after seeing the CG combination again and missed OCTANGLE at F5. I should see that every time. I also think LAG is better in this same spot.
>Chris_Schneider: GLNWY E5 WYL.NG +26 52
#note Now the board is cluttered and I am behind.
>Luckbox_Lindh: BCENOTU -  +0 7
#note D1 BUNCO is worth playing but now I go on an ill-advised fishing expedition. The heat was starting to screw with me. I exchanged BU.
>Chris_Schneider: ?FNRRSU -  +0 52
#note Exchange 3.
>Luckbox_Lindh: CEENOTW D4 WE +15 22
#note This pretty good. The fishing expedition with CONTE continues.
>Chris_Schneider: DIINORT I8 DINITRO +71 123
#note Best play!
>Luckbox_Lindh: CENOTUV 7A VU. +7 29
#note Now I'm just tunneling. I won't even go into the equity loss on this play. I'm focused on bingoing with CONTE.
>Chris_Schneider: JO H14 JO +36 159
>Luckbox_Lindh: CEINOTX B9 EXCITON +116 145
#note Best play! This was my high play of the tournament, which is ironic because it came in my worst played game. A strange marriage indeed! Chris said somebody he knew (Cheryl?) showed him this rack thinking there was no bingo. He quickly found it.
>Chris_Schneider: ?AFINNO 3C FONtINA +78 237
#note Best play! A great find by Chris and now I am completely out of whack. I held this for a minute and then realized I was being stupid.
>Luckbox_Lindh: BDFGQRU -  +0 145
#note Exchange 7. Normally I keep DR, but there were too many R's in the pool, plus there was a blank and 4 S's.
>Chris_Schneider: EERU A5 RE.UE +27 264
>Luckbox_Lindh: ADO H1 DO.A +18 163
#note Incomplete rack.
>Chris_Schneider: ABEN A12 BANE +44 308
>Luckbox_Lindh: AEHOPST 2B POH +31 194
#note I now miss 12F POSTHEAT for 78, which describes how I want the heat to end!
>Chris_Schneider: AHRSZ 11G SH.RAZ +36 344
#note Beautiful play by Chris! I have never seen this word played before.
>Luckbox_Lindh: AAEMSTT L8 MAT.A +38 232
#note Best play!
>Chris_Schneider: IKO M7 KOI +20 364
>Luckbox_Lindh: ELSTTUY 14H ..Y +21 253
#note ASTUTELY! That's 3 missed bingos this game.
>Chris_Schneider: DR 9H R.D +6 370
>Luckbox_Lindh: DELSTTU 5H SLUTTED +72 325
#note Phony! SLUT and THUG are in common English usage but not included in either dictionary. I figured Chris would have to be 100% to challenge this. I did not play this in column N because I need a bingo there as well.
>Chris_Schneider: EILORSU N9 LOUSIER +71 441
#note My comeback is not happening.
>Luckbox_Lindh: CEEFGIP 15L PE.C +33 358
>Chris_Schneider: ?ABIMRS M12 BAR. +23 464
>Luckbox_Lindh: EEEFGIQ 12F QI +13 371
>Chris_Schneider: ?IMS O6 rIMS +19 483
#note This wasn't exactly the endgame, but I can't read my writing on several turns so this is close enough.
>Chris_Schneider:  (FEGEE) +18 501
#note Final score recorded as 501-372. Once again, the endgame is off by a hair.
