#note i did see OXO but i found it much more important to kill that S hook on NAIRU. but is it really that dangerous? QUA also lets him score to the triple, although there's only a couple hook tiles left in the bag. D3 QAID is fine too. -10.5  #strategylarge

#note this move right here, officer. what was i thinking? luckily, i have an exact snapshot into my mental state at the time, so i'll write it here. let's see, i'm up by NINE points and he just set up an obvious S hook (yes, i forgot that it took a T until after i hit the clock). so, he has an S, and likely another E. he just played off two tiles, and my defense has been terrible this tournament, so it all comes down to this next move; it is crucial to prevent his bingo since i'm not ahead by much at all.  this is a 36.5 point mistake (the obvious KEET is the only play here worth making) with no inference; with an EST inference (let's say), this "only" becomes a 33-point mistake. now, with a clear head: it DOES cut his bingo percentage to almost 0%, but he still scores 36 pts on average! and i'm not going to survive that with this lame move. and, most crucially, something that i realized right after, is that no sane person is going to play B(ID)E with a bingo leave. why would he set up a SCORING spot if he has a strong bingo leave, instead of trying to open up another bingo lane? so it's unlikely that he has a strong bingo leave, but is instead trying to set up a 50+ point score next turn. but i freaked out, didn't even think of BIDET, and had already decided to block the bingo lane at all costs.  #strategySADDEST  #focusworst

#note ok, so back when he played REARMING i immediately thought "don't forget the P hook" and was looking for a P all game. right after JAYS played, i realized that i missed KEET, and that BIDE was never a bingo fish. you can imagine my brain immediately short circuiting. what happened? this was the last game of the morning. was i hungry? THIS whole game right here is why i'm not coming close to winning nationals unless i change something, and even though i now know that it is my focus that needs help, actually getting to that deeply focused state requires so much effort (for me) that it is insanely difficult. i pulled it off to a small extent at lake george (and still made a bunch of silly mistakes), but i haven't been practicing. what is my POET even doing; i'm going to let him score a bunch off the P, and i'm not even setting up a hopeful S hook. i seem very undeserving of a 2000 rating when i make mistakes like this, which explains why i'm almost never there.  -19  #strategySADDEST  #focusworst

#note i think he was considering challenging this, but i'm not that lucky. i'm pretty sure that if he challenged, the correct thing to do is to pass back, as there's no way i deserve to win this.
