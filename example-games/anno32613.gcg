#note Now I make this awful play, missing SCIAENID for 86 which anybody above 1200 knows. I certainly knew it, I just didn't find it. Probably a game losing mistake. -52.2.
>Chris_Schneider: ?ADEELU 15A UnLEADE. +80 288
#note Pretty good, but Chris had A1 EDUCABLE for 140. I dodged a bullet here. -60.

#note Maybe B6 NO?
>Chris_Schneider: AZ B6 ZA +67 355
#note Game. Over.
>Luckbox_Lindh: BEINORS E3 B.. +5 209
#note Now I'm in lala land and miss both 12F BICORNES and L1 TABORINES for 74 each. The heat was screwing with my anagramming skills and I was definitely on tilt after drawing an N to SENIOR my previous turn. -a ton
>Chris_Schneider: EORV C9 .OVER +16 371
>Luckbox_Lindh: AEINORS 12G S.ENARIO +70 279
#note Best play. However after missing bingos on 2 of my last 3 turns, it's pretty much over.
>Chris_Schneider: BEGW M9 BEW.G +28 399
>Luckbox_Lindh: PQRSTTU 12A QU.ST +48 327
#note Best play! S's are valuable on this board, but with this consonant heavy rack, it's time to take this play.
>Chris_Schneider: OX N9 OX +54 453
#note Was this a setup by Chris? If it was, this was awesome! I certainly wasn't going to block that line. This play officially cements the game.
>Luckbox_Lindh: EFFIPRS 14J FRISE +44 371
#note I was surprised this sims so low! O4 FIFERS for 55 seems best to me. I did not know FIFER or FIFERS. -15.3

>Luckbox_Lindh: FT 1G F.T +7 430
#note This isn't Chris's actual play. My recreation of this game is off somewhere but this is fine enough.
>Luckbox_Lindh:  (R) +2 432
#note The final score 533-417 because I did not recreate the endgame properly. I am not sure where I went wrong, but the point remains I blew the game by missing SCIAENID and BICORNES/TABORINES. There is the Cliffnotes summary.
