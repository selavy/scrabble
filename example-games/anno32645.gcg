#note Q likes MHO at 10I.  Can't say I disagree,
>David: BO 9K .OB +16 62
>Chris: AEMNOQR H5 QAN.. +14 61
#note QAT is clearly best here.  I felt and I will continue to feel that my best chance to win against a Hall of Famer is to get a blank, and the best way to get a blank is to play as many tiles as possible early in the game.
>David: AEENRUY K5 .....ER +28 90
>Chris: AALMOOR M2 AMORA. +16 77
#note Not sure what I was thinking here, other than I need a blank, and who took all the E's out of the bag?
>David: BEINOST 12F BONIEST +85 175
>Chris: CEEFOTZ 2J ZOE.E +68 145
#note Caught a break, and some E's.

>Chris: CGIJLNT 6D JING.L +19 198
#note JINGAL and GENIC at 10J are about even here.  Hindsight being 20/20, GENIC would have been the better play.
>David: EORU E3 OUR.E +10 220
>Chris: ACCDGIT 13B DICTA +21 219
#note Did not see CACTOID at 3A.  Would've been a "sharp" play.
>David: HI 1N HI +20 240

>David: EIRRSU O6 ERR +19 259
#note I finally put Dave on the defensive.  
>Chris: CEGMOSW D2 CWM +33 304
#note 5th turn in a row with the dreaded CG combination.
>David: ??INSTU N9 SUITiNg +74 333
#note Dave pulled both blanks on a 3 tile draw.  Better to be lucky than good - um - wait - better to be one of the greatest players of all time, and be a little lucky.  Yep, that's best.
>Chris: AEGNOSS 15L GA.S +18 322
#note Q is not a fan of GAGS here.  But with a W and  Y out, I felt that I needed to take this spot and avoid a 30 point play, or worse.
>David: DEWY J10 WE.DY +43 376
#note Yup, I avoided a 30 point play, but couldn't avoid a 43 point play.
>Chris: EENOPSU B9 UPEN.S +30 352
#note SPONDEE slightly better.  I missed it.
>David: ADILRT C3 TAD +25 401
>Chris: EO D6 .OE +13 365
#note So I was bragging to no one in particular that I was the only player who held Dave under 400 this tournament.  Seems we misscored one of his plays.  He hit 400 against everyone.  He's got a future in this game if he sticks with it.
