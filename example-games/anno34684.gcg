>Arie: IORRSUX O6 SOX +39 236
#note Don't know what I should do here. I thought I was sacrificing a bit of equity to eliminate the threat from DAKS, which could get Chris back in the game, as opposed to retaining the S with VOX 10D or TUX 6H. However, it might be worthwhile to hang onto the S and play a 6 from O1 with it next turn, which doesn't offer plays into the southeast quadrant. Also, I should prefer SIX to SOX regardless - not sure what harebrained reason I had for liking SOX. Not sure how SIX compares to TUX and VOX but this isn't right.

>Arie: AEIRRUY A4 .ARIER +27 263
#note This or ERUV - the two plays are very close. ERUV creates a line on row 1 that is hard to deal with long term, so I think I like VARIER. I didn't see ERUV. 
>Chris: AFO 2D OAF +33 163
>Arie: ABGPUUY 13C P.AGUY +26 289
#note This didn't work out very well for me but I think it's fine. The alternative is YUP 3I 29, which scores a bit more but will often get hit with a 2J-N play. PLAGUY takes out B9-15 and the floating L and I, which helps. 
>Chris: EMZ H12 Z.ME +84 247
>Arie: ABIIMUU 10H .UBIA +13 302
#note I think NUBIA is worth playing. It takes out BREWS plays and the floating N, while creating a floating I and A which will probably only last for one turn. I also retain the M for MONO plays which will score at least 36. Sim concurs - my scoring average goes down after NUBIA rather than exchanging, but not by 13 points.

>Arie: CEGGLLQ N13 Q. +11 405
#note No clue what to do here, and Quackle isn't helpful. I can also play QAT for 1 more point, but QI blocks plays like PEcH. He may have HASTENED/HAPTENES throught the E in ZYME, so a play like CEL or GEL, which blocks that spot, may be worthwhile for spread.  This is particularly true after Chris fished. I have two spots for the Q and can't get stuck. I don't think this is right.

>Arie: CEGGHLL 11C G.CH +20 425
#note Looked for an out in two and couldn't find GLUNCH C1 19 before my time ran out. With optimal play after GLUNCH, I win by 124; after GACH I win by 102 with optimal play. 
>Chris: ADDENPS 15D PEND.D +16 312
>Arie: EGLL B8 LEG +12 437
#note LEGIT K7 or LUNGE C2 for one more point. probably 4 suboptimal plays in 14 plays this time.
